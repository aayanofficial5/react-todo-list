# React To-Do List – Assignment 2 (Celebal Internship)

## 📋 Description

This project is part of **Assignment 2** during the **Celebal Internship**. It focuses on building a fully functional **To-Do List** application using **React functional components**, allowing users to add, mark complete, delete, sort, and filter tasks.

The application also integrates **localStorage** to persist tasks across sessions and uses standard **CSS** for styling (no Tailwind or third-party UI libraries).
